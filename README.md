So this is a secound take at this project after seeing some 
over looked aspects, it now only starts the once the user refreshs 
the page and it has a simple refesh button to make playing easier 
I also went back and added comments to my JS function so that it is easier to 
read for anyone looking at the code for the first 

these are simple functions but i believe that it is  just practice to 
get into the habit of comments even for these simple function
